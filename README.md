# 🌍 COVID-19, Heat, and Mobility in Abuja — DS-I Africa Data- & Tool-a-thon (🏆 1st Place)

## Overview
This project was developed during the **DS-I Africa Data- and Tool-a-thon**, where our team ("Team Yellow") won **first place**.  
We explored the relationship between **surface temperature, population mobility, and COVID-19 transmission** in Abuja, Nigeria, during **March 2020** (the early phase of the pandemic).

---

## 🔧 Methods
- **Temperature Prediction**:  
  Leveraged **IBM’s geospatial Land Surface Temperature (LST) model** to predict daily surface temperatures across Abuja in March 2020.
  
- **COVID-19 Data Integration**:  
  Collected and preprocessed early **COVID-19 case data** in Abuja over the same time period.  

- **Data Fusion & Analysis**:  
  - Merged LST predictions with COVID-19 case counts.  
  - Incorporated **mobility data** (trips and intra-city movement patterns) to assess their role in transmission.  
  - Conducted exploratory spatial and temporal analyses to identify associations.

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Temperature**: Despite Abuja experiencing its **hottest months (21–34 °C)**, COVID-19 transmission **increased sharply**.  
- **Mobility**: Population movement did **not significantly decrease** during the lockdown (March 30 – May 15, 2020).  
- **Main Insight**: **Mobility, rather than heat, was the stronger driver** of early COVID-19 spread in Abuja.  
- **Implication**: Highlights the need for **climate-conscious urban planning** and stronger **mobility restriction enforcement** in future pandemic preparedness.

---

## 📌 Limitations
- LST data were available only for a few days during the **heatwave period**.  
- COVID-19 case numbers were **low and potentially under-reported**.  
- Coarse data resolution limited ability to map infections to precise neighborhoods.

## 🌟 Impact
This project demonstrated the **power of integrating climate models, epidemiological data, and mobility patterns** to inform public health strategies.  
By applying machine learning and geospatial analytics, we showed how **data-driven approaches** can reveal hidden drivers of disease transmission in rapidly growing urban centers.  

Our work serves as a foundation for:
- Further **multi-country analyses** of climate and COVID-19 trends.  
- Building **early-warning systems** for infectious diseases influenced by environmental and mobility factors.
